## 📅 Project Journey Summary

### 1. The Proxy & API Blocking Problem
Initially, the website fetched data directly from Yahoo Finance in the browser. Due to strict CORS restrictions and Yahoo blocking public proxy servers (like `allorigins` and `codetabs`), the chart would frequently fail to load. 

### 2. TwelveData API Key Integration
We attempted to migrate to a professional API provider (**TwelveData**). However, we discovered that TwelveData blocks Indian NSE/BSE stock quotes on their free tier, making it impossible to retrieve Indian stock data for free.

### 3. The Netlify Serverless Backend (The Solution)
To bypass CORS and API blocks permanently, we moved data-fetching logic from the browser to a secure serverless environment. We created a custom backend function (`netlify/functions/stock.js`) that queries Yahoo Finance directly. Netlify server-to-server requests are not blocked by browser CORS.

### 4. Features Implemented:
* **Indian & US Stocks in INR:** The backend automatically pulls the live USD/INR exchange rate and converts US stock prices (Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, etc.) into Indian Rupees (₹) dynamically.
* **Responsive Search Autocomplete:** Added a dropdown that triggers suggestions instantly as you type (starting from a single character) and supports keyboard arrow keys + Enter for selection.
* **Top 10 Movers Panel:** Displays live company names (rather than raw tickers) by fetching quotes in parallel on the backend.
* **Formal Data Attribution:** Placed a bold white "Powered by Yahoo Finance API" label at the bottom right of the page background.

## 📂 Code Files Created / Modified

### 1. `netlify/functions/stock.js`
The serverless function handling queries for charts, parallel Top 10 quotes, and search autocompletes with automatic currency conversion.

### 2. `netlify.toml`
Tells Netlify's deployment engine to bundle and run the serverless function.

### 3. `app.js`
Handles frontend rendering, suggestion box interactions, Chart.js updates, and calls the Netlify backend endpoint (`/.netlify/functions/stock`).

### 4. `index.html`
Defines the main glassmorphism page layouts, search input, and sidebar panels.

### 5. `style.css`
Applies modern glassmorphism styling, alert toast animations, search suggestion dropdown overlays, and data attribution positioning.

## 📅 Session 2 Updates (July 20, 2026)

### 1. UI Layering & Search Input Fixes
* **Z-Index Correction:** Resolved a bug where autocomplete suggestions were slipping beneath the "Top 10 Movers" panel (caused by backdrop-filter stacking context rules). Added `position: relative` and `z-index: 100` to `.header` in `style.css`.
* **Search Input Lifecycle:** Removed the hardcoded default search input value. Added `isInitialLoad` checks to `fetchStockData` in `app.js` to ensure the search field starts empty on page load but displays full company names on subsequent searches.

### 2. Branding & Logo Upgrades
* **Custom Logo Badge:** Replaced the previous placeholder logo with the high-resolution bull/bear branding image (`logo.png`). Used CSS crop filters (`scale(1.75)` and `translateY(-3px)`) to focus solely on the graphics.
* **Bull Trend AI Typography:** Updated `index.html` to load the modern geometric **Space Grotesk** font and styled the title text with neon metallic double-gradients in `style.css`.

### 3. SMS Alert Engine
* **Mobile Field:** Integrated a `tel` input element in the alerts UI.
* **SMS Simulation:** Enabled active alert configurations to store phone numbers and trigger simulated SMS notifications (visual status toasts + console logs) when price targets are crossed.

### 4. Zero-Dependency Local Backend (`server.py`)
* Overwrote the mock Python backend with a functional HTTP handler that intercepts `/.netlify/functions/stock` routes and replicates the Netlify serverless routing locally using Python's standard library. Testing locally now has **zero Node.js dependencies**!

## 📅 Session 3 Updates (July 22, 2026)

### 1. "Know More" Company Overview Details Modal
* **Interactive Button:** Added a bold white "Know More" button inside the price card container, styled with an information icon and hover animations.
* **Glassmorphic Popup Overlay:** Created a full-screen backdrop-blurred overlay modal showcasing 12 key metrics, including:
  * Market Capitalization
  * Stock P/E
  * Dividend Yield
  * Day High/Low
  * 52-Week High/Low
  * Day Volume
  * Book Value, Face Value, ROCE, and ROE
* **Owner & CEO Display:** Added a highlighted metadata row displaying the company's CEO, Chairman, or Founder right above the overview paragraph.

### 2. Live fundamental Data Integration (yfinance Backend)
* **Real Live Metrics:** Integrated `yfinance` into [server.py](file:///c:/Users/priya/.gemini/antigravity-ide/scratch/stock-price-alert/server.py) to fetch 100% accurate financial values dynamically for any ticker searched (resolving the previous mock fallback values).
* **Caching Engine:** Added an in-memory caching dictionary in Python with a 5-minute cooldown to prevent IP blocks and keep queries fast.
* **Render Deployment Support:** Added `yfinance` to [requirements.txt](file:///c:/Users/priya/.gemini/antigravity-ide/scratch/stock-price-alert/requirements.txt) to allow Render to build and host the app with all dependencies.
* **Hybrid Fallback Model:** Updated [app.js](file:///c:/Users/priya/.gemini/antigravity-ide/scratch/stock-price-alert/app.js) to dynamically utilize backend-supplied yfinance metrics if available, falling back to simulated values seamlessly on static servers.

### 3. Navigation Menu Addition & Text Refinements
* **Buy / Sell Menu:** Added a new navigation link to the sidebar, styled with your preferred palm-up hand outline icon, and wired to a placeholder layout view section (`#view-trade`).
* **Text Updates:** Renamed the modal launch button from `Know More` to `Know More About The Company` in the price card to provide clearer directions to the user.

### 4. Background Customization Cycles
* **Background Experimentation:** Uploaded and tested multiple background choices (a glowing red cyber cityscape, an abstract red silk wave, and a dark gold wave layout) using cover scaling and 100% border stretch parameters.
* **Restored Defaults:** Reverted the main application background to its clean original neon-blue and violet radial gradient mesh design at the user's preference (while leaving the login page overlay background untouched).

### 5. Instant Autocomplete Relevance & Latency Overhaul
* **Relevance Filtering:** Added single-character autocomplete logic to filter out irrelevant contains matches (e.g. typing `a` no longer displays "Reliance" or "TCS" just because they contain the letter `a`). Single character queries now only return starts-with matches (e.g., Apple, Alphabet).
* **Smart Keystroke Debouncing:** Adjusted autocomplete typing debounce from 150ms to 350ms. This prevents the browser from queuing intermediate queries during rapid typing.
* **Server-Side Cache:** Implemented `SEARCH_RESULT_CACHE` on the backend (`server.py`) to store search results for 10 minutes. Subsequent keystroke lookups respond instantly in under 1ms.

## 🚀 How to Run / Deploy on Your Laptop

### Local Testing (Python Server - Recommended)
1. Double-click `run.bat` or run: `python server.py`
2. Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser. Live stock prices, autocompletes, and alerts will run locally.

### Local Testing (Netlify CLI - Node.js Alternative)
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Start the server: `netlify dev` (Runs the backend from `netlify/functions/stock.js`).

### Deploying to Netlify (Free hosting)
1. Zip this entire folder.
2. Drag and drop the zip file onto [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
3. The site and its serverless functions will be deployed instantly!
